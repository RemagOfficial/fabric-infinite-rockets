# Fabric Disable Firework Boost

Are you tired of players using firework rockets to boost their flight with an elytra, potentially achieving infinite flight? This mod is here to help. Designed for Fabric servers, it disables the use of firework rockets while players are using an elytra. This way, you can still allow them to use the elytra's gliding capabilities, but prevent them from exploiting the firework boost. Simply install the mod on your server to prevent firework boosting.

This server-side mod allows you to continue using firework rockets for all other purposes. However, it does prevent players from using firework rockets to boost their flight while using an elytra.
